                        Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric
                        conditions on Earth. It can result from natural factors, such as volcanic eruptions and
                        variations in solar radiation, as well as human activities, particularly the burning of fossil
                        fuels and deforestation.

                        The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
                        due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas),
                        deforestation, and industrial processes. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere,
                        leading to global warming.

                        Climate change leads to a variety of environmental impacts including more frequent and severe
                        heatwaves, storms, droughts, and flooding. It can also cause rising sea levels, loss of sea ice,
                        and changes in ecosystems and wildlife populations. Human health, agriculture, and water
                        resources can also be adversely affected.

                        Mitigating climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks.
                        This can be achieved through renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, reforestation, and
                        sustainable agriculture. Policies and international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement,
                        also play a crucial role in addressing climate change.

                        Additionally, advocating for climate-friendly policies and educating others about climate change
                        are important steps.
